# 3D-Task-Tracker-with-Data-Structures-Vanilla-JS

An interactive Task Tracker Web Application built using Vanilla JavaScript, featuring real-time visualization of core Data Structures like Binary Search Trees (BST) and Graphs, along with a modern 3D-styled UI.

This project is designed to be both functional and educational, making data structures easy to understand through visual representation.

🚀 Features

✅ Add, Edit, Delete, Complete tasks

🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualization

Tasks are inserted into a BST based on task name

Live canvas rendering of BST structure

🔗 Graph Visualization

Tasks represented as nodes

Visual foundation for task dependencies

🎉 Confetti Animation on task completion

🎨 3D-styled, interactive UI (CSS transforms & effects)

⚡ Fast task operations using hashing concepts

📚 Built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
